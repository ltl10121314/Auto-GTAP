     32    
     33       Version 6-pre2 developed by A.A. Golub and R.A. McDougall, July 2007:
     34           - Reimplement emissions trading with trading blocs.
     35           - Calculate carbon dioxide emissions from the bottom up.
     36           - Reimplement carbon taxation, not converting rates from specific to
     37             ad valorem.
     38           - Reorganize production structure to group equations by nest, and
     39             equip with complete set of technological change variables.
     40           - Introduce energy nest in private and government consumption.
     41           - Revise calculation of "CNTco2trd", contribution of net permit
     42             trading revenue to welfare change.
     43           - Introduce change in ratio of current account to regional income to
     44             maintain homogeneity in the presence of a fixed current account
     45           - Introduce new tax-income ratio variables, change in ratio of
     46             carbon-exclusive taxes to INCOME, del_tnctaxr(r), and change in
     47             ratio of carbon tax to INCOME, del_ctaxr(r).
     48           - Introduce new variable del_ctgshr(r) representing government share
     49             of carbon tax payments/permits revenue.
     50    
     51       Version 6-pre1 developed by R.A. McDougall, April 2006:
     52           -   resync with standard GTAP release 6.2
     53           -   format and module structure fixes
     54    
     55       Version 5 developed by JM Burniaux, September 2001
     56           - includes carbon emissions, emission taxes and trading.
     57           - with a value-added + energy bundle
     58           - plus substitution nesting with capital and a composite energy good
     59           - plus substitution between electricity and energy sources
     60           - plus substitution between coal and liquid fuels boundle
     61           - plus substitution between liquid fuels

     65       HISTORY of the standard file
     66       ----------------------------
     67    
     68       Version 6.2 fixes bugs and provides minor enhancements:
     69           - EV_ALT, CNTdpar fix
     70           - SX_IR fix
     71           - new treatment of export and import tariffs
     72           - original levels defined for power-of-tax variables
     73           - CNTalleffir range extended from TRAD_COMM to DEMD_COMM
     74           - INCOME formula, quantity index equations more AnalyzeGE-friendly
     75    
     76       Version 6.1 fixes bugs in 6.0:
     77           - Computation of tax receipts ratio is now separately done for total
     78             tax and indirect tax (equation DTAXRATIO and DINDTAXRATIO).
     79           - Computation of DTBALR, the ratio of the trade balance to regional
     80             income, has been corrected (equation DTBALRATIO).
     81           - Computation of EV_ALT, the summary variable for EV, has been
     82             corrected (equation EV_DECOMPOSITION).
     83       Also the notation has been changed for the tax-income ratio variables:
     84           TGCR -> del_taxrgc,    TPCR -> del_taxrpc,    TIUR -> del_taxriu,
     85           TFUR -> del_taxrfu,    TOUTR -> del_taxrout,  TEXPR -> del_taxrexp
     86           TIMPR -> del_taxrimp,  TINCR -> del_taxrinc,  DTAXR -> del_ttaxr.
     87    
     88       Version 6.0 replaces version 5.0 used in the August 2000 short course, but
     89       never formally released.  The subsequent changes have been quite
     90       significant (primarily focused on final demand and welfare decomposition),
     91       so we decided to give it a new version number.  This also prevents
     92       confusion with the soon to be released version 5.0 GTAP data set.
     93    
     94       The differences with the previous publicly released version of GTAP.TAB,
     95       Version 4.1, dated November 1998, are numerous.  One goal of this version
     96       is to reorganize the TAB file which had not be redesigned since its
     97       inception.  In addition, there is a long list of substantive changes that
     98       have been made between Version 4.1 and 6.0.  These include:
     99    
    100           - provision for multiple margins sectors (to accommodate post version
    101             5 GTAP data)
    102           - introduction of the new theory of final demand following McDougall's
    103             GTAP Technical Paper #20
    104           - modification of the welfare decomposition following McDougall's
    105             Technical Paper #20
    106           - correction to the treatment of technical change, ao, in the presence
    107             of ESUBT > 0 (affects equations VADEMAND and INTDEMAND)
    108           - addition of import-augmenting "technical change" in the Armington
    109             nest: ams which can be used to lower the effective price of imported
    110             products
    111           - specification of Baldwin-type capital accmulation effects following
    112             Francois' Technical Paper #7
    113           - introduction of uniform consumption tax instrument, tp(r)
    114

    164       Sets define relevant groupings of entities over which we will be
    165       performing operations in the model.  SUBSETS are defined in order to
    166       facilitate summation over only a portion of a given group, e.g., tradeable
    167       commodities.  Users with access to GEMPACK can increase the maximum set
    168       sizes to permit larger aggregations, provided you have sufficient RAM for
    169       implementing them The standard model (10x10 aggregation with decomposition
    170       code) is designed to run with 16 Mb of RAM.

    322       READ Statements of Base Data
    323       ----------------------------
    324    
    325       We read in here almost all the base data, and define variables and
    326       coefficients associated with them.  A few data arrays used each in a
    327       single module are read in those modules: VKB, VTMFSD, and DPARSUM.
    328    
    329       The READ statements are divided into six sections:
    330    
    331       Saving
    332       Government Consumption
    333       Private Consumption
    334       Firms
    335       Global Bank
    336       International Trade and Transport
    337       Carbon Dioxide Emissions
    338       Carbon Taxation
    339    
    340       Since these are invariant for each solution of the model, they are termed
    341       coefficients.  Coefficients are assigned upper case to distinguish them
    342       from variables.  (This is purely cosmetic, as GEMPACK is not
    343       case-sensitive.) Variables in GEMPACK are assigned lower case labels to
    344       denote the fact that they are percentage changes.  In some cases, original
    345       levels values for selected variables are defined to permit the user to
    346       compare post-simulation levels values across several simulations.
    347    
    348       The updating command indicates how the new level of the coefficient will
    349       be computed based on the previous solution of the linearized equations.
    350       Note that the notation used in the update commands is a shorthand for
    351       total differentials of these coefficient values.  Thus, w * v indicates
    352       that we want to take the total differential of W * V, plug in the
    353       calculated values of w and v, and add this to the base level in order to
    354       obtain a revised value for this product.

    826       The following variables could be dropped when converting to levels
    827       equation for income.  They are only needed for the linearized equation.
    828       The idea here is to look at the ratio of taxes to income in order to
    829       preserve homogeneity in prices.  (We could also look at changes in tax
    830       revenue, but then a uniform price increase would change this variable.)
    831       Obviously a simple percentage change variable doesn't work, since many
    832       taxes are initially zero.  The basic logic of this approach is as follows:
    833    
    834       Let R be the ratio of taxes to income: R = T/Y, then:
    835           dR = d(T/Y) = R(t - y)/100
    836       multiply through by Y to get:
    837           YdR = dT - Ty/100
    838       This ratio change is computed for each tax type and for total taxes.  Then
    839       the change in tax revenue itself may be computed as:
    840           dT = YdR + Ty/100
    841       in order to determine regional income.

   2555       funds are allocated across regions to equate the change in the expected
   2556       rates of return (i.e., rore(r)).  When RORDELTA = 0, investment funds are

   2722       includes intraregional imports as well.  In most applications, regions
   2723       will represent groups of individual countries.  However, in the case of
   2724       the EU, this is problematic, since recent versions of the database have
   2725       incorporated intra-EU trade flows.  Therefore, when aggregated to the EU
   2726       level, the composite import price includes both intra-EU and outside

   2857       This equation computes the bilateral demand for international
   2858       transportation services.  It reflects the fact that the demand for
   2859       services along any particular route is proportional to the quantity of
   2860       merchandise shipped [i.e., QXS(i,r,s)].  It is here that we introduce the
   2861       potential for input-augmenting tech change, atmfsd(m,i,r,s), which is
   2862       commodity- and route-specific.  Thus, in the levels:
   2863               ATMFSD(m,i,r,s) * QTMFSD(m,i,r,s) = QXS(i,r,s)
   2864       where QTMFSD is the amount of composite margins services m used along this
   2865       route.  Technological improvements are reflected by atmfsd(i,r,s) > 0, and
   2866       these reduce the margins services required for this i,r,s triplet.  Tech.
   2867       change also dampens the cost of shipping, thereby lowering the CIF price
   2868       implied by a given FOB value (see 6-2).

   4235       In order to maintain homogeneity in the presence of a fixed trade balance,
   4236       it is useful to have a nominal variable which this is measured against.
   4237       The next equation provides this, and we recommend users fix DTBALR instead
   4238       of fixing DTBAL in future simulations.  The strategy is the same one used

   4317       expenditure, "ueprivev", within a shadow demand system for private
   4318       consumption, for use in section B-3.  B-3 calculates private consumption
   4319       expenditure "ypev" for use in B-2, and regional income "yev" for use in
   4320       B-4, within a shadow demand system for the regional household.  B-4

   5253   !The basic idea is to 1. calculate the shadow input price which would give the
   5254   specified reduction in quantity used of the restricted input (note that this
   5255   requires calculating the price of the output induced by these shadow input prices)
   5256   2. use those shadow prices to calculate the actual quantities used of each input.
   5257   3. Use those actual input quantities to calculate actual output prices!

   5276       it should only be endogenized for inputs of the 5 outputs shown below.
